# WELCOME TO THE BALANCE OF FATE GAME V. 2062


This game is going to be my personal, creative rendering of a well-known classic, Tic-Tac-Toe. I wanted to make the game different, quirky, and fun. It intentionally has a very retro look, and personally reminds me of a game you might encounter while playing in an arcade in the 90's. (If the sound isn't automatically playing in your browser (it should be), press play on the top right to enjoy some retro gaming vibes!)

## Game Goals:

1. Must be a two-player browser game (either against the computer or against another player)
2. A winning state - a way for the player to win the game
3. A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game
4. A way to keep playing if the game is not over
5. Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin / end
6. There must be a way to check if the game should
continue or if the overall game is won or lost

## Stretch Goals:

1. A way to reset the board and play again (ACHIEVED)
2. CSS to give your game a personal and fun style (ACHIEVED)
3. Responsive mobile design
4. Determine a way for CPU to play against a player.

## Areas of improvement:

1. More CSS! (Never enough, In my opinion)
2. A way to make the audio controls reliable (sometimes it doesn't automatically play upon user initially opening the page, although, per the code specified in the html, it should).
3. More JavaScript to enhance CSS, such as a drag and drop event for the characters
